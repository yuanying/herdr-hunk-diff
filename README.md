## Requirements

| Name                | Version                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **herdr**           | 0.8.0 or newer on macOS, Linux or Windows |
| **Node**            | 22.12 or newer                            |
| **npm** or **pnpm** | npm 10+ or pnpm 10+                       |

The plugin installs its pinned `hunkdiff` dependency automatically. You do not need a global hunk
installation for reviews opened inside herdr.

Installation uses npm when available, falling back to pnpm. Set `HUNKDIFF_PACKAGE_MANAGER`
to `npm` or `pnpm` to choose explicitly:

```bash
HUNKDIFF_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm herdr plugin install jhochenbaum/herdr-hunk-diff
```

On Windows, hunk ships prebuilt binaries for x64 only, so reviews cannot open on Windows on ARM
unless `[hunk].bin` points at a hunk you built yourself. Everything else — actions, keybindings and
the pager setup — behaves the same on all three platforms.

## Quick start

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
herdr plugin install jhochenbaum/herdr-hunk-diff
```

### 2. Choose how to run actions

<table>
<tr><th width="50%">Recommended: keybindings</th><th width="50%">No setup: CLI</th></tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td>

Most users should install the default bindings:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke setup-keys \
  --plugin jhochenbaum.hunkdiff
herdr server reload-config
```

</td>
<td>

Every action can also be invoked directly:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke review \
  --plugin jhochenbaum.hunkdiff
herdr plugin action invoke send-review \
  --plugin jhochenbaum.hunkdiff
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

| Key              | Action                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `prefix+shift+h` | Review changes         |
| `prefix+shift+s` | Send review to agent   |
| `prefix+shift+c` | Review the last commit |
| `prefix+shift+a` | Review staged changes  |

### 3. Review and send

1. Focus the agent or worktree you want to review in herdr.
2. Press `prefix+shift+h`, or invoke the CLI `review` action.
3. Leave comments with hunk's normal inline-comment controls.
4. Press `prefix+shift+s`, or invoke the CLI `send-review` action.

By default, `review` shows uncommitted changes. When the tree is clean and the branch is ahead
of its base, it shows the branch diff. The plugin reads only your human-authored comments; agent annotations
remain in the review for context.

`send-review` formats all unsent comments into one prompt and submits it to the associated agent.
Successfully delivered comments are removed from hunk by default, and their IDs are recorded so
they cannot be sent twice.

If you close the review before sending, your unsent comments are not lost. The plugin saves them
every few seconds while hunk is open and tells you when it closes with comments still unsent. Run
`send-review` afterwards, with or without the review open, to deliver them. Comments typed in the
last few seconds before closing may not have been saved yet.

> [!NOTE]
> Reviews do not open automatically by default. See [Automatic opening](#automatic-opening) to opt
> in.

## Keybinding behavior

`setup-keys` edits the config file herdr actually loads:

1. `$HERDR_CONFIG_PATH` when set
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/herdr/config.toml`
3. `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`

Before writing, it backs up an existing config to `config.toml.hunkdiff-backup`. It never
overwrites an occupied key. Free bindings are installed, conflicts are reported and skipped, and
invalid TOML is left untouched. Re-running the action installs any bindings that have since become
available.

Remove the managed bindings with:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke remove-keys --plugin jhochenbaum.hunkdiff
herdr server reload-config
```

> [!TIP]
> If you use [`jt.command-palette`](https://github.com/JanTvrdik/herdr-command-palette), every
> action is also searchable by its `hunk: ` title without installing keybindings.

## Review actions

**Opening a review**

| Action          | Review opened                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `review`        | Configured `default_target`; `auto` shows uncommitted changes, or the branch diff when the tree is clean (see `branch_scope`)                   |
| `review:staged` | Staged changes with `hunk diff --staged`                                                                                                        |
| `review:branch` | `<base>...HEAD`, or `<base>` alone when `branch_scope = "worktree"`; falls back to the working tree with a warning when no base can be resolved |
| `review:commit` | The latest commit, or a locally available commit from a Ctrl-clicked GitHub commit URL                                                          |
| `review:stash`  | The most recent stash entry                                                                                                                     |

**Everything else**

| Action            | Effect                                                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `send-review`     | Send all unsent inline comments to the associated agent   |
| `reload`          | Reload the target shown in the current review pane        |
| `close-review`    | Close the review pane for the current worktree            |
| `next-comment`    | Move hunk to the next annotated hunk                      |
| `prev-comment`    | Move hunk to the previous annotated hunk                  |
| `setup-keys`      | Install the default herdr keybindings                     |
| `remove-keys`     | Remove only the keybinding block installed by this plugin |
| `install-pager`   | Configure supported VCS pagers                            |
| `uninstall-pager` | Remove pager configuration owned by this plugin           |

Invoke any action from the CLI with:

```bash
herdr plugin action invoke <action> --plugin jhochenbaum.hunkdiff
```

### Base branch resolution

Branch reviews resolve their base in this order:

1. `review.base`, when set and the ref exists
2. The current branch's upstream, unless it is that branch's own remote-tracking branch
3. `origin/HEAD`
4. The first existing branch named `main`, `master`, or `trunk`

Git does not record the branch a feature branch was created from. Set `review.base` to choose
a different comparison base:

```toml
[review]
base = "origin/develop"
```

If the configured ref cannot be resolved to a commit, the plugin warns and falls back to detection.

### GitHub commit links

Ctrl-clicking a GitHub commit URL opens that commit with `hunk show <sha>`. The commit must already
exist in the current local repository; fetch it first if the plugin reports that it cannot resolve
the SHA.

Pull request URLs are not handled because resolving a PR accurately requires network access and
authentication.

## Configuration

Ask herdr for the plugin's config directory, then create `config.toml` there:

```bash
config_dir="$(herdr plugin config-dir jhochenbaum.hunkdiff)"
${EDITOR:-vi} "$config_dir/config.toml"
```

Files in other locations are ignored. All settings are optional; this is the complete default
configuration:

```toml
[review]
auto_open         = false
on_states         = ["idle"]  # idle | working | blocked | unknown
reuse_pane        = true
default_target    = "auto"    # auto | working | staged | branch
base              = ""        # branch reviews compare against this ref; empty detects one
branch_scope      = "commits" # commits | worktree
watch             = false
placement         = "split"   # overlay | split | tab | zoomed
exclude_untracked = false

[roundtrip]
clear_after_send = true
prompt_template = """Human-authored inline review comments on your changes in {worktree}:

{comments}

Address each comment and verify the resulting changes. If a comment is unclear or requires a decision, ask a focused clarification question and continue with any unaffected comments. Then summarize what you changed and explain anything you did not implement."""

[hunk]
bin          = "auto"
experimental = false
extra_args   = []
```

</details>

### Automatic opening

Set `auto_open = true` to open or refresh a review when an associated agent reaches one of the
configured `on_states`:

```toml
[review]
auto_open = true
on_states = ["idle"]
```

Manual testing with herdr's plugin event hook confirmed that an agent completing a turn arrives as
`idle`. With `auto_open = false`, matching events still associate the agent with its worktree so a
later `send-review` knows where to deliver your comments.

`reuse_pane = true` refreshes the existing review for a worktree instead of opening another pane.
Automatic opens target the pane that emitted the agent event.

### Review target and display

`default_target = "auto"` selects:

1. The working tree when it has staged, unstaged, or untracked changes
2. The branch diff `<base>...HEAD`, when the tree is clean and the branch is ahead of its base
3. The working tree, when neither applies

Set `default_target` to `"working"`, `"staged"`, or `"branch"` for a fixed target.
The pane title identifies the target, for example `Review: my-repo — origin/main...HEAD`
or `Review: my-repo — staged`.

`exclude_untracked = true` hides untracked files in working-tree, staged, and branch reviews, and
also keeps untracked files from making `auto` treat the tree as dirty. Hunk does not accept that
option for commit or stash reviews.

`branch_scope` decides what a branch review compares the base against. The default `"commits"` uses
`<base>...HEAD`, a three-dot range between two commits, so uncommitted edits and untracked files
never appear. `"worktree"` passes `<base>` on its own, which diffs it against the working tree and
therefore includes them. A branch review still requires a base to resolve.

With `"worktree"`, `auto` skips step 1: its branch diff already shows uncommitted changes, so it
picks the branch diff `<base>` whenever the branch is ahead of its base, dirty or not, and the
working tree otherwise.

`placement` supports the four persistent Herdr placements that return a pane ID. Herdr's modal
`popup` placement is intentionally excluded because it cannot be reused, addressed, closed, or
reported through the pane APIs this plugin relies on.

> [!NOTE]
> Hunk owns presentation settings such as theme, split/stack layout, line numbers, wrapping, and
> tab width. Configure those in `~/.config/hunk/config.toml`; this plugin does not override them.

### Round-trip prompts

`prompt_template` supports four placeholders:

| Placeholder  | Value                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `{comments}` | Markdown list of unsent review comments    |
| `{count}`    | Number of comments being sent              |
| `{worktree}` | Absolute path of the reviewed worktree     |
| `{agent}`    | Associated agent name, or `agent` if unset |

Sending is always explicit. Closing a review ends its hunk session, so comments cannot be sent
reliably after the pane has closed.

### Hunk executable

`[hunk].bin = "auto"` resolves the hunk binary bundled with this plugin. Set an absolute path to use
a separately installed binary.

`experimental = true` passes hunk's `--experimental` option, including support for STML-rendered
agent notes. `extra_args` appends string arguments to every hunk launch. If any list item is not a
string, the entire list is rejected to avoid constructing a partial command.

## Optional VCS pager setup

Pager setup is independent of reviews inside herdr. It makes commands such as `git diff`, `git log`,
and `git show` open hunk from any terminal.

First install hunk globally so the pager command remains available across plugin updates:

```bash
npm install --global hunkdiff
herdr plugin action invoke install-pager --plugin jhochenbaum.hunkdiff
```

**Git.** The action writes `core.pager = hunk pager` only after confirming that `hunk` is on
`PATH`. If another pager is configured, the action names the replaced value and prints its restore
command. Multi-valued or unreadable Git configuration is left untouched.

`uninstall-pager` removes only a value this plugin could have installed. It will not remove an
unrelated pager configured later.

**Jujutsu and Sapling.** The action prints the required configuration snippet and edit command;
their configuration is not changed automatically.

## Direct hunk workflows

Herdr plugin actions cannot accept a file, pathspec, patch, or arbitrary revision argument. Install
hunk globally when you need those forms:

```bash
npm install --global hunkdiff

hunk diff -- src/ui          # Review selected paths
hunk patch fix.diff          # Review a patch file
hunk diff before.ts after.ts # Compare two files
hunk show HEAD~1             # Review an arbitrary commit
```

The plugin's bundled executable is intentionally not added to your shell's `PATH`.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>A review pane closes immediately</b></summary>

The plugin sends a Herdr notification when hunk exits unsuccessfully. Inspect the captured action
and event logs for the full failure:

```bash
herdr plugin log list --plugin jhochenbaum.hunkdiff
```

For a linked development checkout, rebuild before retrying:

```bash
npm run build
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>No active hunk session</b></summary>

Open a review before using `send-review`, `reload`, `next-comment`, or `prev-comment`. If hunk is
visibly open, the agent sandbox may be blocking loopback access to `127.0.0.1:47657`. Allow local
loopback traffic or configure both processes with the same `HUNK_MCP_PORT`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>No agent is associated with this worktree</b></summary>

Focus the intended agent pane and open the review again. Review actions invoked from an agent pane
record that pane as the delivery target. Matching agent-status events also record the association.

The index stores one delivery target per worktree. If multiple agents share a checkout, invoke
`send-review` from the intended agent pane or reopen the review from that pane before sending.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Installed keybindings do nothing</b></summary>

Reload Herdr's config after `setup-keys` or `remove-keys`:

```bash
herdr server reload-config
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Configuration appears to be ignored</b></summary>

Confirm that the file is in the directory Herdr reports:

```bash
herdr plugin config-dir jhochenbaum.hunkdiff
```

Invalid TOML and invalid values fall back to defaults.

</details>

## Known limitations

- Review actions cannot receive pathspecs, patch paths, file pairs, or arbitrary revisions.
- Stash reviews cannot be reloaded in place; close and reopen them.
- Sending comments is explicit through `send-review`; closing a pane saves them but does not send
  them, and saved comments are not shown again in a reopened review.
- GitHub links support commits already present locally, not pull requests.
- Agent-authored notes require a live hunk session. The bundled
  [`hunk-herdr-review` skill](skills/hunk-herdr-review/SKILL.md) documents that workflow.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
npm run build
npm test
```

For pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
pnpm run format:check
pnpm run lint
pnpm run build
pnpm test
```

Keep `package-lock.json` current when changing dependencies. npm installs use this lockfile;
pnpm resolves the ranges in `package.json`. Both use the same pinned Hunk version.
The pnpm path skips dependency build scripts and uses Hunk's prebuilt platform binary.

CI checks formatting, lint, TypeScript compilation, tests, and dependency vulnerabilities.
It also verifies installation, builds, and the Hunk launcher with npm and pnpm on Linux and Windows.

## Prior art

[`persiyanov/herdr-reviewr`](https://github.com/persiyanov/herdr-reviewr) covers similar workflows
with its own diff viewer. This plugin is for users who specifically want hunk's review UI and live
session API.
